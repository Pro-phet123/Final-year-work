# credit-card-fraud-detection-system-
The credit card fraud detection system detects online fraud using the input data of the user. The Model uses a Gui to collect the necessary data and when the predict button is clicked on by the user, the model predicts if the credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Dataset Description
The dataset I used is a sample of a dataset gotten from Kaggle. It contains six million online credit card transaction samples and 11 features of each transaction. An autoencoder was used for the development(which includes training and testing the model) and Streamlit was used to create a web app for the application.
