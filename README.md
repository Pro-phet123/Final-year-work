# credit-card-fraud-detection-system-
The credit card fraud detection system detects online fraud using the input data of the user. The Model uses a Gui to collect the necessary data and when the predict button is clicked on by the user, the model predicts if the credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Dataset Description
The dataset I used is a sample of a dataset gotten from Kaggle. It contains six million online credit card transaction samples and 11 features of each transaction. An autoencoder was used for the development(which includes training and testing the model) and Streamlit was used to create a web app for the application.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection System Web-Based GUI

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) built to analyze online credit card transactions and predict fraudulent activities. It utilizes Python programming with libraries such as Streamlit, NumPy, TensorFlow, and pandas to create an interactive and informative platform.

## Features

Dataset Exploration: Provides insights into the online credit card transactions dataset, sourced from Kaggle, including key features and sample data.

*Data Visualizations:* Visualizes the distribution of online credit card transactions to understand trends and patterns.

*Model Prediction:* Utilizes a deep learning autoencoder algorithm to predict fraudulent transactions based on user input.
